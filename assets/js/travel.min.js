Continuing to welcome travellers each summer with its enticing rural landscapes, UNESCO World Heritage status and blankets of history, it makes a special escape away from touristic honeypots. Throw in scattered ruins, delicious delicacies and sleepy villages and you’re on the way to a well-rounded summer vacay.","The island of Crete is the kind of place to make all your dreams of a holiday in Greece come true. Crystal-clear blue waters, postcard-worthy seafront towns, history in spades and jaw-dropping landscape, Greece’s largest island has everything you could wish for. Whether you want to trek the Samaria Gorge or wander the atmospheric winding alleyways of Chania, boat-trip to deserted beaches or learn the art of Cretan cooking there’s no Greek island that offers more variety.","Looking for a destination with a party-hard culture, cashed-up A-listers and hip new everything, Mykonos ticks all three. It was one of the first of the Greek islands to be considered a holiday destination and has been popular since the 60s. There are over 25 beaches on Mykonos, all but a handful are well-organized with sunbeds, umbrellas, water sports, beach bars, restaurants and markets. The golden sand and shallow, clear water make them ideal for pretty much everyone.","The supermodel of the Greek islands, Santorini. The volcanic nature of the island contributes greatly to its drama; the towns sit perched on top of steep cliffs and boasts white-washed houses peppered with blue church domes with bright pops of candy colours. Swoon.","Paros sleeps in the shadow of the limelight and yet it continues to welcome a steady stream of summer travellers. The island shares the same qualities as many of the other Cyclades Islands – whitewashed villages, fishing harbours, a flurry of tavernas and golden beaches –  our favourite being Kolymbithres. The granite rock formations on the beach will transport you back to your fav sci-fi movie. Paros lacks the same glitzy appeal as Mykonos and Santorini, but in our eyes, it’s a star.","The largest and most popular of the Dodecanese Islands, Rhodes stuns with its romantic medieval Old Town, glistening beach resorts and 300 days of sunshine. It’s most touristy by the town, but don’t worry you can still find secluded spots in and around the island. If anything, it’s worth taking a car and taking unconventional detours, passing beaches and pretty coastal villages on the way. Sun worshippers can exhale, the island has a vast collection of beaches, all unique in their own right. Among the best beaches are Tsambika, Ladiko and Kallithea.

And as the second smallest country in the world, Monaco makes a cracking summer destination. What they don’t tell you about Monaco is how colourful and captivating it is when you see it with your own two eyes. Of course, not forgetting the amazing history filled with barbarians, kings, supercars, movie stars and bags of money. Francois Grimaldi, you did well.","Visit Corsica, France’s isle of beauty. This miniature continent lies 200 kilometres from the French Riviera and yet it feels very rugged, old-world and spectacular all at once. The Corsican way of life is simple and unplanned, tourists are left in peace to enjoy the dense forests, the time-forgotten villages, national parks and not forgetting the GR20 trail.

In between the pastel coloured boutiques, plunging mountains and sun-kissed sunbathers – the coast has an irresistible appeal. Until the 1950’s, this coastline was largely undiscovered and relatively poor, with its economy almost solely reliant on fishing and the growing of lemon trees. And now? Well, it’s become a major summer destination attracting travellers from all around the world.","Both a tourist destination for Italians and foreigners, Capri’s beauty and refined hedonism has charmed just about everyone. The island is a speckled fusion of grottoes, caves, Roman ruins, overgrown vegetable plots and rich wildlife. Once you’ve seen your fair share of sights, including the Blue Grotto, the Gardens of Augustus and the Port of Marina Grande to name a few, you can also decide to explore the other treasures on the other islands of the Bay of Naples. Day trips to Pompeii, Ischia (the green island), and the Amalfi Coast are totally recommended.","Scenic hikes, coastal trails and some of the loveliest beaches off European shores, Sardinia is a sight for sore eyes. It may be the largest Italian island, but a visit will make you feel as though you have the whole island entirely to yourself. You’ll quickly realise that Sardinia isn’t just a pretty face, but that every nook and cranny has its own story to tell.

Ibiza is roughly ten times the size of Manhattan and in that area, you’ll find a huge diversity of landscapes, activities and cultural curiosities to enjoy.
